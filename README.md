I am a Senior Mobile App Engineer with vast experience in Mobile Software Architecture, design patterns, and development.
I have been writing Kotlin over the last 4+ years, following Google's recommended design patterns, clean architecture, dependency injection, Jetpack components, and Kotlin Coroutines for reactive programming. I am most proficient in Kotlin for Android Development, Swift for iOS Programming and currently advancing my Jetpack compose and Swift UI.

I have a proven track record of translating designs into life by writing clean, maintainable, extensible, and testable Android Applications. I pride myself in building impeccable Android Apps, not only in terms of performance but also in terms of usability and reliability.

##### Here are some basic stuffs about me:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a number of Projects both on iOS using Swift and Android using Kotlin.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift for iOS developement.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Kotlin based projects.
- 💬 Ask me about Android development using Kotlin.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am self driven, self-motivated, self-disciplined and results oriented.
